# The mechanics of Mandarin
Unlike English, Mandarin uses characters to form sentences. A word consists of one or more of these characters, and each character has its own one-syllable pronunciation. 我们, pronounced "wǒ men", is a word that has two characters, which collectively mean "we" or "us".

This is known as a language with **analytic phonics** — where each phoneme has its own meaning, instead of in English: "en" has no meaning, and neither do "gl" and "ish". Synthetic-phoneme languages generally 'smush' sounds together to modify the meaning of a word, often by switching out the world prefixes or suffixes of the word. Analytic-phoneme languages, on the other hand, don't really. It's a bit of a sliding scale, though.

## Writing Mandarin
Mandarin is certainly different from English in both the way it sounds and the way it is written. Characters are formed using **radicals**, which all have their own 'pseudomeanings' that combine into a coherent meaning. For example, <ruby>大 <rt>dà</rt></ruby>, which means "big", can be seen in other characters such as <ruby>太 <rt>tài</rt></ruby> ("too (much)") and <ruby>天 <rt>tiān</rt></ruby> ("day" or "sky"). So, if you don't know a character, you may be able to infer it from its looks.

Chinese characters are almost always drawn from top-left to bottom-right.

## Pinyin
Up until the 1950s, there was no easy way to express the pronunciation of Mandarin characters in writing. Pinyin (拼音) was introduced as a way of writing Chinese characters phonetically, much like how in English, we also write can words somewhat phonetically (fuh-neh-tuh-klee).

Pinyin was mainly invented as a means to allow the Chinese to enter Mandarin into computers. Chinese has thousands of unique characters which would never fit on a keyboard, and so they needed to find an alternative way of entering them in. After many iterations, they settled on using a QWERTY keyboard to enter pinyin. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBDwXipHykQ" target="_blank">Here's a great video that I recommend if you want to learn more about the development of Chinese text entry.</a>

## Tones
Each character has a unique sound, but pronunication is important. The meaning of a spoken word can change drastically if the **tone** is different. Pinyin represents this by using accents.

* **Tone 1** (flat): 妈 \[mā\] means "mother"
* **Tone 2** (rising): 嘛 \[má\] means "fibre"
* **Tone 3** (bouncing): 马 \[mǎ\] means "horse"
* **Tone 4** (falling): 骂 \[mà\] means "curse"
* **Tone 5** (neutral): 吗 \[ma\] is used to turn a statement into a question

...So be careful not to accidentally refer to your mum as a horse!
