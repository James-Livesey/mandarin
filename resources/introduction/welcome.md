<abbr title="[dà jiā · hǎo] Hello!">大家好！</abbr> Welcome to my notes for learning Mandarin Chinese. I've been learning Mandarin for the past few years, and I'm now in the process of digitising my notes from my Mandarin notebook onto this site.

Hopefully this resource is useful for anyone who is starting to learn Mandarin, or even who — like me — have passed the HSK 1 test and wants to continue studying it.
