<abbr title="[dà jiā · hǎo] Hello!">大家好！</abbr> Welcome to my notes for learning Mandarin Chinese. I've been learning Mandarin for the past few years, and I'm now in the process of digitising my notes from my Mandarin notebook onto this site.

Hopefully this resource is useful for anyone who is starting to learn Mandarin, or even who — like me — have passed the HSK 1 test and wants to continue studying it.

## Why learn Mandarin?
* **It's the 2nd most widely spoken language worldwide**, at over 1 billion speakers. It's catching up very closely to English by just 15 million speakers.
* **It's both easy and hard at the same time.** Easy because you don't really have to deal with many conjugations and word forms (thx French...), but hard because it's an entirely different way of writing words and memorising them.
* **There's over twice** as many Chinese internet users as there are people in the United States. That's over 11 times for the UK!
* **It looks cool!** And yes, that's genuinely one of the reasons as to why I wanted to learn it lol
