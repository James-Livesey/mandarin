# Common phrases
With any languge, it's a good idea to start by learning what "hello" means, right‽ Well, let's start with that...

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>你好</strong> <span>hello</span> <span>nǐ · hǎo</span>
</div>

Funnily enough, a large portion of non-Chinese speakers know this one. Ask somebody random to say what they know in Chinese, and the chances are, they will say 你好! So, in that case, we haven't got very far with learning Chinese.

We can, however, turn this into a question. You may be wondering how, but it's simple — 你 means "you", and 好 means "good". When we say "hello" in Chinese, we're actually saying "you good!" — it doesn't make too much sense in English, but that's how it's said in Mandarin. Adding <ruby>吗 <rt>ma</rt></ruby> turns the statement into a question, and so our sentence will now mean "How are you?".

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>你好吗？</strong> <span>How are you?</span> <span>nǐ · hǎo · ma?</span>
</div>

We can respond simply by saying "I'm good, thank you":

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>我很好，谢谢！</strong> <span>I am good, thank you!</span> <span>wǒ · hěn · hǎo, · xiè xiè!</span>
</div>

<ruby>我 <rt>wǒ</rt></ruby> means "I", <ruby>很 <rt>hěn</rt></ruby> means "am", and <ruby>谢谢 <rt>xiè xiè</rt> means "thank you". Let's continue...

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>你叫什么名字？</strong> <span>What is your name?</span> <span>nǐ · jiào · shén me · míng zì?</span>
</div>

This one is quite long; let's break it down:

<ul>
    <li><abbr title="[jiào]">叫</abbr> call (you by)</li>
    <li><abbr title="[shén me]">什么</abbr> what</li>
    <li><abbr title="[míng zì]">名字</abbr> name</li>
</ul>

Let's now respond to that question:

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>我叫James！</strong> <span>My name is James!</span> <span>wǒ · jiào · James!</span>
</div>

As you'll see in a moment when we move onto pronouns, <ruby>我 <rt>wǒ</rt></ruby> means "I", and as we've already seen with 你叫什么名字？, 叫 essentially means "am called". So, putting it all together, you get "I am called \_\_\_\_".

If — like me — you have a name that's spelt with Latin characters, then usually you'd just put the Latin name there. Alternatively, you can put your name into <a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=en&tl=zh-CN&op=translate" target="_blank">Google Translate</a> and find out what the equivalent would be in Chinese. So, in that case, call me <abbr title="[zhān mǔ shì] James">詹姆士</abbr> from now on!
