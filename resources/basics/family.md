# Family
Typically, after learning about pronouns in Mandarin, we'd move onto learning about members of the family, because it ties in really well with pronouns.

Let's start with the parents:

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>妈妈</strong> <span>mum</span> <span>mā mā</span>
</div>

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>爸爸</strong> <span>dad</span> <span>bà ba</span>
</div>

They're not too hard to remember — they're pretty much modelled around the first words that babies learn, and are almost universal at this point. The siblings are a bit trickier:

<div class="split">
    <div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>弟弟</strong> <span>younger brother</span> <span>dì dì</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>哥哥</strong> <span>older brother</span> <span>gē gē</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>弟弟</strong> <span>younger sister</span> <span>mèi mei</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>姐姐</strong> <span>older sister</span> <span>jiě jiě</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

To refer to a family member, you say <ruby>我 <rt>wǒ</rt></ruby>, followed by the family member. For example, <ruby>我妈妈 <rt>wǒ mā mā</rt></ruby> means "my mother", and <ruby>我哥哥 <rt>wǒ gē gē</rt></ruby> means "my older brother".

## "I have..."
To say that you have three older sisters, you'd write <ruby>我有三个姐姐 <rt>wǒ yǒu sān gè jiě jiě</rt></ruby>. 有 means "have", and goes between the subject and the object (much like in English). 个 kinda means "of", and is known as a <strong>measure word</strong> — which can be different, depending on the noun we're talking about. I'd say that 个 is the most common when talking about counting people.

> **Exception:** When talking about two of something, you must use <ruby>两 <rt>liǎng</rt></ruby> instead of 二.

## Pets
I'll introduce you to a few words for pets — we're not going to go through too many, such as wild geese or ferrets, but I'll go through some common ones.

<div class="split">
    <div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>猫</strong> <span>cat</span> <span>māo</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>兔子</strong> <span>rabbit</span> <span>tù zi</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>鸟</strong> <span>bird</span> <span>niǎo</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>狗</strong> <span>dog</span> <span>gǒu</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>鱼</strong> <span>fish</span> <span>yú</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>蛇</strong> <span>snake</span> <span>shé</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Some of them are not too hard. 猫 and 狗 both appear to have tail-like radicals in their characters (犭) which differentiate them from the rest; 鸟 looks like a bird; and 鱼 looks like a fish bowl. The others... Yeah, I'll leave it up to your imagination to think about what relation those characters have to rabbits and snakes!

> **Note:** The measure word for animals is <ruby>只 <rt>zhī</rt></ruby>. So, to say "four cats", you'd write <ruby>四只猫 <rt>sì zhī māo</rt></ruby>.
