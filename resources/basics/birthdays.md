# Birthdays
We've learnt pronouns, numbers and family, so it's now possible to learn how to say when your birthday is! I'll also introduce you to how to say dates in Mandarin, too.

## Dates
There are three characters that are used in Mandarin to construct a date:

<div class="split">
    <div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>年</strong> <span>year</span> <span>nián</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>月</strong> <span>month</span> <span>yuè</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>日</strong> <span>day</span> <span>rì</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Dates are expressed as a the year number, then 年, then the month number (一 is January, and so on, until December with 二十), then 月, then the day of the month, then 日. Let's run through a few examples:

<div class="split">
    <div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>十一月十四日</strong> <span>Fourteenth of November</span> <span>shí yī · yuè · shí sì · rì</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>2012年5月23日</strong> <span>23rd of May 2012</span> <span>liǎng qiān líng shí èr · nián · wǔ · yuè · èr shí sān · rì</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Remember that the year goes first, then the month, and finally the day.

## Happy Birthday!
Here's how to say "Happy Birthday!":

<div class="split">
    <div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>生日</strong> <span>Birthday</span> <span>shēng rì</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>快乐</strong> <span>Happy</span> <span>kuài lè</span>
        </div>
        <div class="phrase">
            <strong>生日快乐！</strong> <span>Happy Birthday!</span> <span>shēng rì · kuài lè!</span>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

You'll notice that it's the other way around to how we say it in English — we don't say "Birthday Happy!" — it's just a little exception to remember.
