# Pronouns
A pronoun is a word that directly references something. In English, we have "I"; "you"; "he", "she" and "it"; "we"; "you"; and "they". Chinese has a really simple and clever way of dealing with pronouns. Let me show you:

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>我</strong> <span>I</span> <span>wǒ</span>
</div>

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>你</strong> <span>you (singular)</span> <span>nǐ</span>
</div>

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>他</strong> <span>he, it, they</span> <span>tā</span>
</div>

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>她</strong> <span>she</span> <span>tā</span>
</div>

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>我们</strong> <span>we, us</span> <span>wǒ men</span>
</div>

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>你们</strong> <span>you (plural)</span> <span>nǐ men</span>
</div>

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>他们</strong> <span>they (male/mixed)</span> <span>tā men</span>
</div>

<div class="phrase">
    <strong>她们</strong> <span>they (female only)</span> <span>tā men</span>
</div>

You'll notice that <ruby>他 <rt>tā</rt></ruby> and <ruby>她 <rt>tā</rt></ruby> sound the same. That generally is because unlike in English, where we have two separate words for "he" and "she", Chinese only differs the words by modifying one of the radicals to be 女 (meaning "female") for 她, from 亻 (meaning "male").

That'll be enough to get by for now. Let's move on!

You'll also notice the clever bit: for groups of multiple people, <ruby>们 <rt>men</rt></ruby> is added. I wish we could have something like that in English!
